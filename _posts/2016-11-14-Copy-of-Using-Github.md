    <td>luckily this week we didn't have a computer that was completely zoomed in and can't check if your work was actually working. After we finished last week's coding we started with a new one and this one was very different to all the others because there were some keys that we had never used before in this code. Also there was lots of writing in it but it ended up working really well. You had to keep changing partner because otherwise it would just lack off.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Because this exercise was really long it took us ages to do. Looking for new keys was our main problem. At the start of the lesson there were no spare computers so it took us a while to see what we could do. In the end we had to do the work on the projecter so the whole class could see are mistakes.</td>

    <td>Next time my partner and I will make sure that we get a computer first so we don't have to get in trouble with it again. Because we have started the next exercise we need to get through it quickly because we are behind a few groups.</td>
